With a kitchen island or cart you can get more storage and work space instantly and at a budget friendly price. It s remarkable what a little paint can do to a piece of ikea furniture. Plus a cart makes it easier to set and clear your dining table. Between this and all the ikea bed hacks from last week i m not going to be able to stay out of ikea.</p>

<p>With a kitchen island or cart you can get more storage and work space instantly and at a budget friendly price. By adding a coat of paint and a marble top this cart was truly transformed into a beautiful piece that would look amazing in just about any kitchen. Plus i ve simplified the process. The ikea website uses cookies which make the site simpler to use. Peeling paint dried on drips and roller marks are not the hallmarks of a high end furniture piece.</p>

<p>Kitchens contain lots of instant things. Kitchen nook and painted kitchen cabinets all done. However i can t assemble it. Also i spray painted the pipe with flat black spray paint from krylon. For instant storage and countertop space try a kitchen island or a kitchen cart.</p>

<p>I thought it would make a great addition to my kitchen and later when i don t need it in the kitchen i can use it for art supplies. With a kitchen island or cart you can get more storage and work space instantly and at a budget friendly price. Ordered brushed brass hardware from cb2 and installed. Paint is my favourite way to inexpensively add style and charm to damaged or outdated piece. By adding a coat of paint and a marble top this cart was truly transformed into a beautiful piece that would look amazing in just about any kitchen.</p>
