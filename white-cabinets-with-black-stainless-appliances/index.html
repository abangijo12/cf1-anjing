<p>While stainless steel is undoubtedly the most popular appliance finish for a kitchen black takes a close second and white well that s a whole different topic. The cabinet over the sink could have been the same size as the remaining cabinets and a different faucet shuld have been. A white kitchen with black appliances can make a beautiful statement this fails to do so. Example of a small danish single wall kitchen design in other with flat panel cabinets white cabinets laminate countertops black appliances a drop in sink white backsplash subway tile backsplash and beige countertops to me this says serviceable kitchen i like that it s plain and has basics like subway tile.

If you already have white kitchen cabinets another way to pull off a black and white kitchen look is by using black built in appliances or using black hardware to contrast with the white cabinetry. A white kitchen with black appliances can make a beautiful statement this fails to do so. It is not the issue of the black appliances breaking up the fluidity of the design it is that the design is flawed.
