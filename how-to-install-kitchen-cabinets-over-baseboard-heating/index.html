<p>Solid blue is current cabinet dotted blue is new cabinet and red is baseboard. There is not enough wall space to put efficient cabinets with counter space except the wall with windows. I m taking care of that first since the vent and baseboard is set back behind the bench. From the positioning line and shim the base until the top is even with the horizontal line and level from front to back. The plan is to extend the kitchen to take advantage of as much space as possible but this requires placing new cabinets over existing baseboard heaters.</p>

<p>I ve looked into kickboard heat countertop heat and relocating the copper piping in the basement to provide for floor registers in front of the cabinets. I will be adding a decorative toe kick cover so my bench base 4 narrower than the bench depth. I m taking care of that first since the vent and baseboard is set back behind the bench. If the pipe comes up through the floor to the baseboard and then goes back down then remove the baseboard radiator and reconnect the pipe ends with a straight pipe covered with insulation along the basement ceiling. The other baseboard in the room is about 5 and half.</p>

Second same as above but also build a false back on the cabinet allowing a chamber behind the same or greater depth as the radiator to allow air to come in from below and circulate above and behind the cabinet. We would have put some feet on the cabinets for aesthetic reasons and then mounted the countertop. It would be very hard to find a place in this kitchen to move the baseboard heater.
