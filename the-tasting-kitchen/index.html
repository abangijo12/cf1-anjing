<p>I d like to start by saying this was probably the best service i have had at a restaurant. The tasting kitchen s space is a mix of exposed brick wood beams huge windows and even olive trees that all combine for a pretty unique effect. The tasting kitchen is a contemporary restaurant with a new american farm to table heritage using traditional and classic regional diction with thoughtful local growers to guide guests through the ever changing landscape of southern californian cuisine. The restaurant reinforces their scratch kitchen philosophy with handmade pastas in house. We had an early reservation for 6pm friday and arrived just before 6pm.</p>
