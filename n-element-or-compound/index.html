<p>It is a colourless odourless tasteless gas that is the most plentiful element in earth s atmosphere and is a constituent of all living matter. Although a compound may be composed of two different elements it tends to possess a different chemical structure that is completely unique from. Each atom type contains the same number of protons. Compounds are formed when a chemical reaction occurs in which atoms of elements bond together creating a new substance. The difference between an element and a compound is that an element is a substance made of same type of atoms whereas a compound is made of different elements in definite proportions examples of elements include iron copper hydrogen and oxygen examples of compounds include water h 2 o and salt sodium chloride nacl. Each element corresponds to a single entry on the periodic table.</p>
