<p>The official subreddit for scott cawthon s horror game series five nights at freddy s. And this is fnaf 1 and i also keep seeing page 11 with all the heads looking at cam 5. I do believe that there s a pitch black image for the video of the kitchen in fnaf 1 but i lost links for the game files and i m unable to extract them from the exe if there s an image for that area someone should brighten it and configure the contrast to see if there s anything. Not just the pictures from the texture files these are the rare easter eggs not include the regular easter eggs that actually found during the gameplay. There is a total of 10 cameras in the pizzeria each named after their location.</p>

<p>The only way that i know this is because on the fifth night you can see glow white eyes in the kitchen. All look the same but vary in stats and attacks which are taken into account to classify them in a difficulty scale from 1 to 5 the game uses stars to indicate this with 1. The camera here is disabled but the player can still hear audio. The bots all looking at the camera cam 1a. Probably to add effect.</p>
