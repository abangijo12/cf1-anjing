<p>N nitroso compounds nocs include two chemical classes nitrosamines and nitrosamides which are formed by the reaction of amines and amides respectively with nitrosating agents derived from nitrite 1 4 nitrosamides which are direct alkylating agents that do not require metabolic activation 2 5 are potent neuro carcinogens in animal models especially through. The n nitroso compounds fall into the category of carcinogens discovered through proposed industrial use barnes 1974.

Several hundred n nitroso compounds have been tested as carcinogens and over 80 have been found to be carcinogenic in at least 40 animal models eichholzer and guzwiller 1998. N nitrososarcosine is a nitrosamine that is sarcosine in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen has been replaced by a nitroso group.</p>
