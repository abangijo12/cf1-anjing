Several hundred n nitroso compounds have been tested as carcinogens and over 80 have been found to be carcinogenic in at least 40 animal models eichholzer and guzwiller 1998. N nitrososarcosine is a nitrosamine that is sarcosine in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen has been replaced by a nitroso group.</p>
