<p><strong>Ikea Farmhouse Sink Discontinued</strong>. I am still back and forth with ikea to uphold their warranty but it will cost far more than that to replace sink. A very popular one is the ikea domsjo sink which comes in 37 wide or 24 wide and is very affordable. It seemed the average price for a nice heavy ceramic sink was around 700. Well at that price i was willing to give it a go and so the domsjo sink was installed and took pride of place in our new farmhouse kitchen.</p>

<p>Has anyone found a good replacement. It has taken abuse from staff forgetting to clean it kids forgetting to shut it and the usual day to day rucus of use in a busy place. Unfortunately the crowd favorite double basin sink by ikea has been discontinued since dec 2017. We did an ikea kitchen a few years ago and put in a single bowl domsjo sink that has since been discontinued due to cracking which of course we now have. We were lucky enough to get one of the last ones available it has since been discontinued.</p>
