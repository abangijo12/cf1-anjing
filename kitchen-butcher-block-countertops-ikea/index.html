I chose the ikea butcher block countertops because i felt like that gave me the most high end look for my limited budget and i loved the warmth of the wood. Expected solid wood rather than wood composite shabang it was probably an oversight on my behalf but we ordered the island countertop online believing it was like the wood butcher block type ikea countertops we put in years ago.</p>
